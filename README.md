What is generative AI

Generative AI (Gen AI) uses machine learning to create new content like text, images, or code. It automates tasks and supports creativity, transforming how we work and innovate.

2. Skill Sets

1. Prerequesties
      1. Python Programming Language 
      2. Basic Machine Learning Natural Language Processing 
          TFIDF
          Word2vec,AvgWord2vec
      3. Basic Deep Learning Concepts 
          ANN - Working Of MultiLayered Neural Network
          Forward Propogation, Backward Propogation
          Activation Functions, Loss Functions
          Optimizers
      4. Advanced NLP Concepts 
          RNN, LSTM RNN
          GRU RNN
          Bidirection LSTM RNN
          Encoder Decoder, Attention is all you need ,Seq to Seq
          Transformers
      5. Starting the Journey Towards Generative AI (GPT4,Mistral 7B, LLAMA, Hugging Face Open Source LLM Models,Google Palm Model)
      OpenAI
      Langchain
      Chainlit
      Google Gemini
      5. Vector Databases And Vector Stores
      ChromaDB
        FAISS vector database, which makes use of the Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS) library
        LanceDB vector database based on the Lance data format
        Cassandra DB For storing Vectors
      6. Deployment Of LLM Projects
        AWS
        Azure
        LangSmith
        LangServe
        HuggingFace Spaces
2. Skill Sets
   GEN AI works with
   1. LLM(Large Language Models)
   2. LIM (Large Image Models)
   3. Multimodel

   Open source models
    1. Meta Llama2
    2. Mistral
    3. Falcon
       
   Paid models
    1. Open AI
    2. Llama2
    3. AI21 Lab
    4. Mistral
    5. Gemini pro
   AWS : Bed rock - platform - stable diffusion (Image) - at present support OpenAI
  it's giving API, Fine tuning
   
   Differences between open source and paid models
    - Need to check the use case compatability
    - Security
    - Scalability
    - accuracy
    - PROD readinesss support
    - Cloud dependenmcy (i want to manage vs self managed)

Gen AI Framework (Provides setup of linrary)
1. Hugging face - it support all open and paid models(Open AI will not support) - pay as you go
2. Open AI
3. Lang chain - General framwork (Provide agent functionality - for data ingestions and transformations
4. LLama index - for RAG
5. Chainlit
6. Streamlit - for UI

Vector - DB
1. Chromo DB
2. Casendra
3. Datastax
4. pinecone

Task
1. Create project,
2. Use LLM
3. Vector DB
4. Framework (Lang chain/Llama Index
5. Data bases
6. Deployments

Fine tune with custom data using LLM models
